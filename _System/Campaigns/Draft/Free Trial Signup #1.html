									<h1 style="font-size: 24px; color: black; margin: 0 0 21px;">Hi {tag_recipientfirstname}!</h1>
									Thanks for signing up for a free trial of our Online Business solution! While you're test driving your Online Business over the next 4 weeks, we're going to send you one a newsletter each week to help you make a success of it.<br>
		              <br>

									If you have any questions, please let us know - I'm sure we can be of assistance. Without further ado, let's get into it - Tip 1:<br>
<br>

									<h1 style="margin: 0 0 21px;">Update your site regularly</h1>

									<img src="newsletter-img/reload.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right: 18px;">
									Can you update your site yourself? We're not talking about major graphic design surgery (leave that for the experts); just news and announcements, maybe some articles you've written, or a fortnightly blog post or two.<br>
				          <br> 

									Search engines and <a href="http://sharemarketing.wordpress.com/2008/03/24/social-media-aggregators-a-list/">social media aggregators</a> are always hunting for fresh, valuable content on websites - so the more content you add and the the more often you do it, the higher the chance that you'll rank highly in organic search results.<br>
  <br>

									Now, the next question is - what to write? This is the hardest bit, so we've prepared three strategies to help you figure out what to write about.<br><br>

									<ul>
									<li><strong>What's Been Happening - </strong>in the last month of your business? Did you make any milestones in terms of customers, product releases or new staff hires? Write about them! Customers love to read positive things about your business - it shows you're authentic and successful.</li>
									<li><strong>Share a Lesson - </strong>Did something special or interesting happen to you that taught you a positive lesson. You went to the coffee shop and were really "wowed" by their customer service. Perhaps they even inspired you to improve your own service. Share these stories with your customers on a blog post! They're fun, interesting and they say a lot about your business values.</li>
									<li><strong>How-To, History-of, How-it-works</strong> - visitors come to your website because they're interested in your purpose, your products and services and how you can help them. Better explain to them well if you want them to keep reading on...</li>
								  </ul>

									There's always something to write, just remember the 2 golden rules of content and you'll be fine:<br><br>
									<ul>
										<li>Is the content relevant to your customers and your business?</li>
										<li>Does the content add value to your customers?</li>
									</ul>
